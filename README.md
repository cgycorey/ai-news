## Scheduling Automated Collection

The AI News tool supports automated collection through cron jobs:

### Setting Up Schedule

1. **Configure collection interval:**
   ```bash
   # Set daily collection at 2 AM
   ai-news schedule set daily
   
   # Set hourly collection
   ai-news schedule set hourly
   
   # Set weekly collection (Sunday 3 AM)
   ai-news schedule set weekly
   ```

2. **Get cron setup instructions:**
   ```bash
   ai-news schedule cron-setup
   ```

3. **Add cron job:**
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # Add the line shown by cron-setup command
   ```

### Managing Schedule

```bash
# Show current schedule status
ai-news schedule show

# Clear schedule (remove from config, remember to remove cron job)
ai-news schedule clear
```

### Cron Schedule Examples

- **Hourly:** `0 * * * *` - Runs at the start of every hour
- **Daily:** `0 2 * * *` - Runs at 2:00 AM every day  
- **Weekly:** `0 3 * * 0` - Runs at 3:00 AM on Sundays

The tool will collect news from all configured RSS feeds on the specified schedule.

## Regional News Collection

The AI News tool supports region-specific news collection with separate feed groups for different geographic regions.

### Supported Regions

- **US** (us) - United States
- **UK** (uk) - United Kingdom  
- **EU** (eu) - European Union
- **APAC** (apac) - Asia-Pacific
- **Global** (global) - International/General feeds

### Regional Commands

#### Collect from Specific Region
```bash
# Collect from UK only
uv run ai-news collect --region uk

# Collect from multiple regions
uv run ai-news collect --regions uk,eu

# Collect from all regions (default)
uv run ai-news collect
```

#### Filter Articles by Region
```bash
# List UK articles
uv run ai-news list --region uk

# Search within US region
uv run ai-news search "fintech" --region us

# Get statistics for all regions
uv run ai-news stats --all-regions
```

#### Manage Regional Feeds
```bash
# Add feed to UK region
uv run ai-news feeds add --region uk --name "UK Insurance News" --url "https://uk-insurance.com/rss" --category insurance

# List UK feeds
uv run ai-news feeds list --region uk

# List all feeds by region
uv run ai-news feeds list

# Remove feed from region
uv run ai-news feeds remove "UK Insurance News" --region uk
```

### Migration from Old Configuration

If you have an existing configuration with flat feeds structure, run the migration script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_regions.py config.json
```

This will:
- Move existing feeds to 'global' region
- Create empty regions for US, UK, EU, APAC
- Backup your original config file

### Regional Scheduling

You can set up different collection schedules for each region:

```bash
# Set daily collection for UK feeds
uv run ai-news schedule set daily --region uk

# Set hourly collection for US feeds  
uv run ai-news schedule set hourly --region us
```

## 🔧 **Installation & Setup**

### **Method 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone and setup automatically
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-news
cd ai-news
./quick-start.sh
```

### **Method 2: Manual Setup**
```bash
# Install dependencies
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync

# Download AI models (happens automatically on first run)
uv run python quick-ai-news.py
```

### **UV Workflow Integration**

This system is built around **uv** - the modern Python package manager. All commands use the `uv run ai-news` format:

```bash
# ✅ ALWAYS use this pattern:
uv run ai-news <command> [options]

# ✅ Examples of proper usage:
uv run ai-news collect --hours 24
uv run ai-news digest --topic "machine learning"
uv run ai-news setup-nltk
uv run ai-news setup-spacy

# ❌ NEVER use without uv:
ai-news collect  # This won't work properly
```

**Why UV?** 🚀
- **Fast dependency management** - 10x faster than pip
- **Isolated environments** - No conflicts with system Python
- **Consistent behavior** - Works the same everywhere
- **Modern Python tooling** - Built for 2024+ development

**First-Time Setup Commands:**
```bash
# Download NLTK data (required for text processing)
uv run ai-news setup-nltk

# Download spaCy models (optional, for advanced NLP)
uv run ai-news setup-spacy

# Check NLTK data status
uv run ai-news setup-nltk --check
```

### **System Requirements**
- **Python:** 3.10 or higher (managed by uv)
- **Memory:** 4GB+ recommended
- **Storage:** 500MB+ for data and models
